## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I can position background elements using background-position, and then further fine-tune the final position by using right, left, bottom, center as well as vw and vh.
- Flexbox is very tricky, but always remember that it's just boxes inside boxes.
